We have successfully implemented the basic structure of the recipe maker app with methods to perform various recipe management tasks such as viewing, adding, updating, and deleting recipes.
The command-line interface provides a simple way for users to interact with the application and perform these tasks.

Instructions to run the code:
1. Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., recipie_database.py).
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the Python file using a Python interpretera. (e.g., python3 recipie_database.py).
4. Follow the prompts in the command-line interface to interact with the Recipe Maker application.
